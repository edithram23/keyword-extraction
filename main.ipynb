    "  - **Performance and Scalability**:\n",
    "    - the document retrieval is more flexible compared to other vectorDB\n",
    "    - the scalability is much better in ElasticSearch\n",
    "  - **Flexibility**: It handles both structured (pre-defined keywords) and unstructured data (extracted keywords or embeddings) seamlessly.  \n",
    "  - Simple search methods to KNN based search is offered\n",
    "\n",
    " **Use of GenAI:**<br>\n",
    "  *Employee confidentiallity needs to be protected first - redacting the sensitive information from the stories.*\n",
    "  - Open source models like **Llama3.3** etc can be used to extract keywords.\n",

    "  - [TNT-LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12173) : The TNT LLM extracts contextually relevant keywords and performs semantic analysis for ranking and retrieval. It efficiently processes both structured documents and simple text paragraphs. \n",
